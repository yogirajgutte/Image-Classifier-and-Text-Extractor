This tool was made by me and my colleague as a project for college.
The repository contains 'Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks.pdf' as a report to this project
Follow the guidelines given below in order to use it.




1) 'Model Training and Testing' folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks with code for training and testing of the models.

2) 'Web-Based GUI' folder contains a web-based app which can be used for data visualization and model testing.

3) 'What's On My Screen' folder contains the standalone app based on the CNN model and Tesseract Engine. It can be used in realtime. More details are present in the folder.

4) Extract 'Model_tf.zip' to the same directory.

5) 'Model_tf' folder contains the trained model. It is important as both the apps use data from this folder. There's no need to open this folder.
